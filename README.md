## 🚀 Getting Started

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
```

### 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

The project includes an automated CI/CD pipeline that runs on every push to the repository. The pipeline:

1. Sets up Python environment
2. Installs dependencies
3. Trains the model
4. Runs all tests
5. Validates model performance

## 📊 Model Architecture

The CNN architecture consists of:
- Input Layer (28x28 grayscale images)
- Block 1:
  - Conv2d Layer 1 (1→8 channels, 3x3 kernel)
  - Conv2d Layer 2 (8→16 channels, 3x3 kernel)
  - BatchNorm2d
  - MaxPool2d
  - Dropout (0.1)
- Block 2:
  - Conv2d Layer 3 (16→16 channels, 3x3 kernel)
  - Conv2d Layer 4 (16→32 channels, 3x3 kernel)
  - BatchNorm2d
  - MaxPool2d
  - Dropout (0.1)
- Block 3:
  - Conv2d Layer 5 (32→16 channels, 3x3 kernel)
  - Conv2d Layer 6 (16→10 channels, 3x3 kernel)
- Output Block:
  - Flatten Layer
  - Fully Connected Layer (90→10 units)
  - LogSoftmax activation

## 🖼️ Data Augmentation

The training process includes three augmentation techniques:
1. **Random Rotation**: Rotates images up to ±30 degrees
2. **Horizontal Flip (X-Flip)**: Mirrors the image horizontally
3. **Vertical Flip (Y-Flip)**: Mirrors the image vertically

Sample augmented images are saved in the `augmentation_samples/` directory during training.
Each sample shows:
- Original image
- Rotation augmentation
- X-Flip transformation
- Y-Flip transformation

Note: While flipping digits might create unrealistic samples for some numbers (like 6 and 9), 
this helps the model learn more robust features and handle various orientations.

## 🏷️ Model Versioning

Models are automatically saved with timestamps in the format:
```
model_mnist_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.pth
```
